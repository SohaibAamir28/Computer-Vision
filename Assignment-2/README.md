# Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition

This project implements real-time face detection and recognition using `keras-facenet` and `mtcnn`. The application captures video frames from the webcam, detects faces, and compares them with stored face embeddings to determine if the person is authorized or unauthorized.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- `keras-facenet`
- `mtcnn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy keras tensorflow keras-facenet mtcnn scikit-learn
